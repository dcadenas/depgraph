* Added dynamic loading of node finders from directory lib/nodefinders.
 Example:
   see 'lib/nodefinders/TestNodeFinder.rb' which can be used like this:
   depgraph -type test
* Added functionality to exclude the nodes the user is not interested in.
 Example:
   depgraph -type ruby_requires -exc "client, server"
* A transitive reduction can be applied to the graph.
 Example:
   depgraph -type csproj -trans
* Disconnected nodes don't show up anymore.
* The type of output can be selected by changing the file extension. 
 Example:
   depgraph -type test -output test.dot
